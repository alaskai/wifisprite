## üöÄ Installation

1. **Install Python 3.7+**
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (uses netsh commands)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Administrator privileges (for network scanning)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Tests

### Passive Analysis Only
- Encryption type detection
- Signal strength measurement
- Network name pattern analysis
- Captive portal checking
- No active network attacks or intrusion

### Risk Factors Evaluated
- **Encryption Strength**: WEP (high risk) to WPA3 (low risk)
- **Network Naming**: Suspicious patterns like "Free WiFi"
- **Signal Characteristics**: Unusual signal strength patterns
- **Public Network Indicators**: Captive portals, open access

## üéì Educational Value

### Security Concepts Explained
- What WiFi encryption means
- Why VPNs are important
- How to identify secure networks
- General WiFi safety practices

### Risk Communication
- **High Risk**: Red - Avoid sensitive activities
- **Medium Risk**: Orange - Use VPN, be cautious
- **Low Risk**: Yellow - Generally safe with precautions
- **Minimal Risk**: Green - Secure network
