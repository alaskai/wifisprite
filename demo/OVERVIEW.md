# Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Name
**WiFi Sprite - Advanced WiFi Security Analyzer**

## 🚀 Summary
WiFi Sprite is a comprehensive, ethical cybersecurity tool designed specifically for South Africa's unique threat landscape. It provides advanced network security analysis to detect ESP32-based fake access points, honeypots, and network vulnerabilities without compromising or attacking networks. The tool combines passive analysis, gamification, and threat intelligence to educate users about WiFi security risks.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🛡️ Safe Scan Mode**: Analyze nearby networks without connecting
- **🔍 Multi-Level Analysis**: Simple, Advanced, and Safe scanning modes
- **🚨 ESP32/Arduino Detection**: Identifies DIY honeypot devices
- **📋 Threat Logging**: Track dangerous networks with MAC addresses and locations
- **🏆 Gamification System**: Security score, achievements, and level progression
- **🎨 Professional UI**: Dark theme with colored security reports
- **🌍 Localized for South Africa**: Targets regional cybersecurity threats

## 💡 Inspiration
The project was inspired by the growing prevalence of ESP32-based fake access points and honeypots in South African public spaces like shopping malls, coffee shops, and airports. Many users unknowingly connect to malicious networks that harvest credentials or monitor traffic. WiFi Sprite addresses this by providing an educational, defensive tool that helps users identify and avoid these threats while building a community database of dangerous networks.
